# Programmatic Diagramming

This was my attempt at programmatically generating diagrams for the OS layering
effort for OpenShift. This makes use of the
[Diagrams](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/) library for Python as well as
Graphviz. 

One can use the included Dockerfile to reproduce the development environment.
